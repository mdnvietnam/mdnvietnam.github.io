# MDN Vietnam Minisite
[![Travis CI build](https://api.travis-ci.org/mdnvietnam/mdnvietnam.github.io.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/mdnvietnam/mdnvietnam.github.io)

Inspired by git-awards.com and commits.top websites, I created this microsite to honor top contributors to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) for the [Vietnamese locale](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/revisions?locale=vi), to encourage more Vietnamese language speakers will join the effort to make MDN the best reference and guide for Web development among Vietnamese developers community.

Live site: [https://mdnvietnam.github.io/](https://mdnvietnam.github.io/)
