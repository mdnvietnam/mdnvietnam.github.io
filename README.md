# MDN VI l10n Top Contributors

Inspired by git-awards.com and commits.top websites, I created this microsite to honor top contributors to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) for the [Vietnamese locale](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/dashboards/revisions?locale=vi), encourage more Vietnamese speakers will join the effort to make MDN the best reference and guide for Web development.

## TODO

- [X] Basic site styles
- [X] Paginate index page with list of authors (sorted by number of articles)
